# Friends of Lain

Friends of Lain is a Cyberpunk and WebDev dedicated website. I have a blog, a poetry section, and a coming portfolio section. The purpose of FoL is to develop my web design and development skills, and a place for me to talk about them as well!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

A text editor such as Atom, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or Emacs

A new version of Chrome or Firefox. I'm running Firefox for testing.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
